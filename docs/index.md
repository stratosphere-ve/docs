# Welcome to Stratosphere

Slow down there for a second.  
Before you start messing with plugins or whatever else you’re trying to dive into,  
Please take a moment to read our [introductory docs](https://stratosphere-ve.github.io).

It should only take about **10–25 minutes** if you actually know what you're doing with Python.  
(And realistically, you *should* know Python if you're planning on contributing anything.  
We don't do Python tutorials.)

I’m a solo dev working on this slowly, and not acting very smartly at coding this

**It helps a lot in advancing this project**. Every bit of progress matters, especially at this stage.
