# Welcome to Stratosphere
Slow down there! before you start making plugins or whatever your doing, please read our [introductory docs](https://stratosphere-ve.github.io). this should take 10-25 minutes if you know what your doing with python. (you should know python if your doing anything related to contributing, if not we do not provide tutorials on how to code with python.)
